# SLEF export plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/wiki)

This plugin allows to copy the loadout of the current ship into the user's clipboard. The data will be in [SLEF](https://inara.cz/inara-impexp-slef/) format


## Installation

1. On EDMC's Plugins settings tab press the _Open_ button. This reveals the _plugins_ folder where EDMC looks for plugins.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Thurion/SLEF-export/releases).
3. Open the _.zip_ archive that you downloaded and move the _SLEF-export_ folder contained inside into the _plugins_ folder.

You will need to re-start EDMC for it to notice the new plugin.

## Usage

Just launch the game with EDMC running. As soon as a loadout is detected, the button will be enabled. After clicking it, just open a 
supporting application (e.g. [Shield Tester (Python Version)](https://github.com/Thurion/D2EA_Shield_tester/tree/master/Python_port))
and paste it using CTRL+V.
